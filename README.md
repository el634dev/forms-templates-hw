## Setup
The requirements for this project are simple and do not require much setup. You will need a code editor of your choice. I used VSCode because I could run commands in the terminal. There are no dependencies, only additional plugins if you would like to set them up in VSCode. If you are unsure, then I would say Pylint is okay but this just ensures your code is following code convention. You can get all the plugins in VSCode in the side menu, it looks like blocks.
